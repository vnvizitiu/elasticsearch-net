     * === Custom Serialization
	 *
	 * NEST 6.x ships with a _shaded_ Json.NET dependency, meaning that all of Json.NET's types are
	 * internalized and IL merged into the NEST assembly, and their namespace has been changed
	 * from `Newtonsoft.Json` to `Nest.Json`.
	 *
	 * Why would we do this, you may ask? Well, NEST has always isolated its dependency on Json.NET as best as it could,
	 * but this meant that we had to mandate how certain things were in the client. For instance,
	 * NEST heavily relied on the fact that the `IContractResolver` used by the configured serializer was
	 * an instance of `ElasticContractResolver`, so if you wanted to deserialize your `_source` or `_fields`
	 * using your own resolver, you were out of luck. In addition, continued improvements to NEST's serialization pipeline
	 * was stymied by this dependency and as client authors, we wanted to unhinder ourselves from this in order to explore the myriad
	 * of exciting developments happening in the .NET ecosystem around performance with the likes of `Span<T>`,
	 * `ArrayPool<T>` and a more compact UTF-8 string representation.
	 *
	 * So what did we do in 6.x and how does it affect you?
	 *
	 * The `NEST` nuget package from 6.0.0 onwards will use the internal Json.NET serializer and will in effect, behave the same
	 * as it did in previous releases. If you previously relied on custom Json.NET serialization and configuration with custom
	 * `JsonSerializerSettings` and `JsonConverter` types for example, things have changed a bit. The following section explains
	 * how to continue working with these with NEST 6.x.

		 * ==== Injecting a new serializer
		 *
		 * Starting with NEST 6.x you can inject a serializer that is isolated to only be called
		 * for the (de)serialization of `_source`, `_fields`, or wherever a user provided value is expected
		 * to be written and returned.
		 *
		 * Within NEST, we refer to this serializer as the `SourceSerializer`.
		 *
		 * Another serializer also exists within NEST known as the `RequestResponseSerializer`. This serializer is internal
		 * and is responsible for serializing the request and response types that are part of NEST.
		 *
		 * If `SourceSerializer` is left unconfigured, the internal `RequestResponseSerializer` is the `SourceSerializer` as well.
		 *
		 * Implementing `IElasticsearchSerializer` is technically enough to inject your own `SourceSerializer`
